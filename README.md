# Array Cardio Day 1

## The JavaScript30 Challenge is a  course created by Wes Bos. The course is designed to help developers improve their JavaScript skills by building 30 different projects, each focused on a specific aspect of the language.

Array Cardio Day 1 is one of the projects in the JavaScript30 Challenge. This project is focused on helping developers become more proficient with array methods in JavaScript. Specifically, the project covers four different array methods: filter(), map(), sort(), and reduce().

Throughout the project, developers are presented with a series of exercises and challenges that require them to use these array methods in different ways. By completing these exercises, developers gain a deeper understanding of how these array methods work and how they can be used to manipulate and analyze data in JavaScript.

Overall, the JavaScript30 Challenge Array Cardio Day 1 project is a great way for developers to sharpen their skills with one of the most important data structures in JavaScript, and to gain a better understanding of how to use array methods effectively in their own projects.
